    <h1>Experiments</h1>
    <p>
      I'm improving my understanding of web technologies in general.
      As I'm learning, I've made these experiments involving aspects of
      front end development,
      and I'll describe what I've learned from them as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my pages, I try as best as I can to implement progressive enhancement,
      such that it will still display nicely on browsers that only
      support text (such as Lynx, Links, w3m). This was done by ensuring the HTML
      is somewhat sensible &mdash; as if it were a regular paper, no matter how
      unfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only that, I also try to use graceful degradation by making sure
      the page would still be visible in browsers that do not support
      Javascript (or have it deliberately disabled for security reasons) -
      there are no loading screens baked into the HTML nor are any of the
      elements are hidden by "default".
    </p>
    <div class="card-list">
      <section class="card">
        <h2><a href="xhtml_motion_test">XHTML in 2021</a></h2>
          <p>
            This is a modern landing page, but it's written using valid
            XHTML 1.1 Strict &mdash; a form of HTML most people have left behind.
            Even so, this makes use of relatively modern
            CSS features (custom properties, chrome's <var>backdrop-filter</var>)
            as well as some of the more recent JS features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this page I discovered the difference in how the browser
            handles <var>Content-Type</var>. Using <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>,
            with an "xhtml" extension, the page is rendered using the XML renderer.
            The CSS <em>does not</em> block
            renders here. The usual <code>text/html</code> on the other hand, will
            block rendering until the CSS is fully loaded.
            In my opinion, that might be another reason why people apply the content
            type of <code>text/html</code> even if technically it's only possible
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/01/xhtml-mimetype/">for compatibility</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also experimented with another way to express the relationship
            between markup and style &mdash; even though it may be the opposite of good
            practices &mdash; for the purpose of exploring CSS selectors.
            Proper IDs are used whenever an anchor is needed. The convention
            used there is as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>"Global" classes ("objects") are not prefixed</li>
              <li>"Local" classes, that is, parts inside an object are prefixed with <code>-</code></li>
              <li>Utility classes for Javascript hooks and such are prefixed with <code>_</code></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The usual problem lies with specificity, but it may be improved by making
            the CSS reflect the markup order in the HTML, at the cost of possibly
            separating otherwise related markup. Not only that, there is also
            the problem of over-using the non-semantic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag, a problem
            solved in HTML5 with the various additional tags such as <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, among others.
