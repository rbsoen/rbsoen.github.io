    <h1>Experiments</h1>
    <p>
      I'm improving my understanding of web technologies in general.
      As I'm learning, I've made these experiments involving aspects of
      front end development,
      and I'll describe what I've learned from them as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my pages, I try as best as I can to implement progressive enhancement,
      such that it will still display nicely on browsers that only
      support text (such as Lynx, Links, w3m). This was done by ensuring the HTML
      is somewhat sensible &mdash; as if it were a regular paper, no matter how
      unfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only that, I also try to use graceful degradation by making sure
      the page would still be visible in browsers that do not support
      Javascript (or have it deliberately disabled for security reasons).

                    This is a pure web application that is the exception
                    to the should-not-have-Javascript rule, because it is
                    completely client-side using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB</a>
                    to store information.
                    Because it uses IndexedDB, all data is stored inside the
                    specific profile of the specific browser that it is accessed
                    in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All forms are pre-rendered in the HTML, and then shown, hidden,
                    and manipulated using vanilla JavaScript - of which a relatively
                    minimal amount is used. The total amount of code in its source
                    form (including external libraries) is about 32 kb.
                    The code is not the most optimal, and there are a few bugs (such as
                    submit actions working, but not when pressing "Enter"), however
                    I believe it serves my personal needs well for now.

                This is a modern landing page, but it's written using valid
                XHTML 1.1 Strict &mdash; a form of HTML most people have left behind.
                Even so, this makes use of relatively modern
                CSS features (custom properties, chrome's <var>backdrop-filter</var>)
                as well as some of the more recent JS features.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this page I discovered the difference in how the browser
                handles <var>Content-Type</var>. Using <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>,
                with an "xhtml" extension, the page is rendered using the XML renderer.
                The CSS <em>does not</em> block
                renders here. The usual <code>text/html</code> on the other hand, will
                block rendering until the CSS is fully loaded.
                In my opinion, that might be another reason why people apply the content
                type of <code>text/html</code> even if technically it's only possible
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/01/xhtml-mimetype/">for compatibility</a>.
