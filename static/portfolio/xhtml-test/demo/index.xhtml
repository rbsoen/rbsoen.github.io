    XHTML is essentially restricting myself to a subset of HTML4. Using invalid
    elements won't cause web browsers to refuse displaying the page but WILL cause
    a validation error.
  -->
  <!--
    Everything here is strung together using class lists. I know it's not a
    very good idea, but xhtml disallows data-* and the new html5 attributes.

    Markers:
      - `_triggerable`: Has a javascript hook on a trigger (e.g. scroll)
      - `_bindable`: Has a javascript hook on an event

    `_triggerable`:
      - `_fly-words-in`. Pops up a sentence one word at a time. Arguments:
        - `_from-left`
        - `_from-bottom`
      - `_fade-in`. You must contain block-level elements inside it.
        - `_slide-from-left`
        - `_slide-from-right`
        - `_slide-from-bottom`

  <!--
    Class name conventions:
      prefixed with _ = utility / script hooks
      prefixed with - = local
      no prefix       = global

            It's never a bad idea to learn more about the inner
            workings of the web, beyond what brand-name frameworks
            and methodologies would provide. I may gain appreciation
            for the history of web technologies and the various
            compromises it made. In addition, I may leverage
            HTML more effectively to deliver web pages that are
            as semantically sensible as they are graphically
            fantastic.

            In my youth, I had to work on limited quota through mobile
            data. Not only that, I had a laptop very much limited in
            resources, only having about 2 GB of RAM. Hence, I know that
            websites should optimize for that scenario. However there
            are more aspects that I must optimize other than simply
            less data usage, because if it were the only thing I care
            about, I would simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)">minify</a> everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accessibility is something to consider when creating a website.
            At the very least, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/low-contrast/">contrast issues</a>.
            As a graphic designer, I admittedly overlook this a lot. However,
            I think websites need more consideration since they live in
            small screens be it through a notebook laptop or a smartphone.
            Another way to complete the accessibility problem is by using semantic tags
            whenever possible, ensuring that if the website is accessed by
            something other than a web browser, assistive technologies may
            accurately convey the contents of the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, a website is made by its' contents. Some measures which
            may satisfy the developer or the artist may not be desirable to me,
            a user, who wants to page to just load &mdash; things like loading screens
            and anti-<abbr title="flash of unstyled content">FOUC</abbr>
            measures &mdash; must not get in the way of whatever content I want
            to access.

        <div class="_triggerable _fade-in _slide-from-left">
          <p>
            Among the various ideas to define the
            relationship between HTML markup and CSS layout, one that I tend
            to agree the most is that CSS design should depend on the
            associated markup. This is simply due to the fact that graphical
            web browsers are not the only applications able to parse HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm aware of the possible issues it may bring when it comes
            to scaling and maintaining the code, but my opinion is that nothing
            can't be fixed with adequate documentation.
            Therefore, I believe a good way of thinking about making websites that
            fulfill design soundness and user comfort might be as follows:
          </p>
        </div>
        <ul class="card-list _triggerable _fade-in _slide-from-right">
          <li class="card">
            <b>Writing the content first</b>, because this is the
            most important part of any page where content is worth
            having. I would write the HTML as if I was writing for a
            command line display.
          </li>
          <li class="card">
            <b>Designing the layout</b>, adjust it around the content.
            I'd make it attractive, but not in a way that obstructs the
            content. I try to use the above user-minded considerations.
          </li>
          <li class="card">
            <b>Implementing the layout to the content</b>. This ensures
            that the site remains reasonably compatible when accessed
            using any device, while bringing normal users a fast
            experience.

              <p>
                XHTML was an effort by the W3C to bring
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/DraconianErrorHandling">strict error handling</a>
                through the use of the XML parser. It wasn't very popular
                among developer circles.

                <pre><code><![CDATA[
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  printf("Hello!\n");
