Sekelas (initially named Nodes) was a startup founded in 2020 by Rezaldy AM. It was a platform for students to be able to discuss and exchange class notes. Initially had an Instagram and LINE presence, soon a website was launched in the form of sekelas.net, which had university SSO integration, rankings, and forum. The domain has sadly since expired.

My contributions include cover designs and several elements of the website design, unified under an exciting design language.
