### Visualizer
{{< youtube nSs4OCN7vt8 >}}

Visualizer was made in Blender.

### Detail
Coproduction with M. Aufa.

Also [published](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnypjopnISo/) in the official OSIS Smanti Instagram account.

Published under "Keluku", an alias I planned to use for music productions (but never have much use for it...)

*Heavily* inspired by the main theme for OWL Reborn: Crosslions - Reborn.

Uses samples from a gamelan sample pack, Martin Garrix - Tremor (sampled lead), O.T. Genasis - Coco, Eta Terangkanlah
